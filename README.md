Hi! I'm Ziqian Wang, a Mathematics undergraduate at Imperial College London.

This repository collects my machine learning projects and experiments.  
I'm particularly interested in:

- Statistical machine learning
- Deep learning
- Applied probability for AI

## Projects

- Logistic regression from scratch with gradient descent
- (coming soon) MNIST classification with PyTorch
- (coming soon) Optimisation experiments (GD vs SGD vs Adam)

More projects will be added over time.
