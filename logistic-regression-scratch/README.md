# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements binary logistic regression **from scratch** using NumPy only.  
The goal is to go from the **mathematical formulation** of the model to a **working classifier**,  
including optimisation with gradient descent and visualisation of the learned decision boundary.

## 📘 Overview

In this project, I:

- Derived the logistic regression model and the binary cross-entropy loss  
- Computed gradients $\partial J / \partial w$ and $\partial J / \partial b$ analytically  
- Implemented gradient descent manually  
- Generated a 2D synthetic dataset  
- Visualised the loss curve and the final decision boundary  
- Evaluated the model accuracy  

This project demonstrates the connection between **mathematical modelling** and **practical machine learning implementation**, which is especially relevant for applied mathematics & ML research.
